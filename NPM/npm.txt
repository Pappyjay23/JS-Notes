Note: You do not upload packages to github but rather the package.json file since it's all embedded there. And once deleted to review just type npm install and all the packages of the dependencies will be brought back.

In the script section of the package.json file you can add your script for bundling
e.g browserify back_test.js > bundle.js && live-server

npm run (script name added to package.json)
